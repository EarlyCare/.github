## About Us

EarlyCare is an organization dedicated to developing advanced AI-driven solutions for early detection and prediction of cancer. Our mission is to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to assist healthcare professionals and patients in making informed decisions for better health outcomes.

## Our Projects

### Cancer Prediction Models

#### 1. Lung Cancer Prediction
Our Lung Cancer Prediction model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze medical data and predict the likelihood of lung cancer. Early detection can significantly improve the chances of successful treatment and recovery.

#### 2. Breast Cancer Prediction
The Breast Cancer Prediction model is designed to help detect breast cancer at an early stage. By analyzing various risk factors and medical histories, the model provides accurate predictions to aid in early intervention.
